The interface to yajl_config is servicable but not quite right.
There was some confusion about the behavior of yajl_config when
the Fortran interface was written, and it was quickly patched up
(see the commented-out code and comments), but never properly fixed.
Yajl_config is a varargs function, which makes a fully-functioning
interface to it high impossible.  What's required is a different
C api that will play nicely with Fortran.  Others developing
bindings for other languages expressed the same frustration.

A prototype interface to the yajl JSON generator was added but
only partially tested.  It exposed a bug in YAJL where a double
value like 1.0 would be written simply as "1", which would be
interpreted rightly by a JSON parser as an integer value, when
what is wanted is a double value.  At that point development on
this part of the interface was tabled.  The bug was reported, and
confirmed by other users, but has never been fixed as far as I know.
