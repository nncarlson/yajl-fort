A prototype interface to the yajl JSON generator was added but
only partially tested.  It exposed a bug in YAJL where a double
value like 1.0 would be written simply as "1", which would be
interpreted rightly by a JSON parser as an integer value, when
what is wanted is a double value.  At that point development on
this part of the interface was tabled.  The bug was reported, and
confirmed by other users, but has never been fixed as far as I know.
