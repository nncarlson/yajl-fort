YAJL-Fort

YAJL (Yet Another JSON Library) is an event-driven parser for JSON (JavaScript
Object Notation) format data streams.  The YAJL-Fort package provides a modern
Fortran interface to the YAJL library.  Notwithstanding its name, the JSON text
format is language independent and an excellent data interchange format.  It is
light-weight, flexible, easy for humans to read and write, all of which make it
a superior format to XML for expressing input files, for example.

The source consists of a single file yajl_fort.F90 which implements the
interface, plus two small files (f90_assert.F90 and f90_assert.fpp) that
implement a simple DBC (design-by-contract) system, that can be easily
incorporated into a larger software project.  The DBC can be easily stripped
or disabled from the code, if desired.  Alternatively, code can be compiled
into a library using the cmake-based build system

The YAJL-Fort package is hosted on SourceForge: http://yajl-fort.sf.net

Compiling
--------

The code is written in modern Fortran (read 2008) and requires a compiler
that has a fairly complete implementation of the standard, which many do not.
At this time the following compilers are known to work:

  NAG versions >= 5.3
  Intel versions >= 13.0

The following compilers are known NOT to work:

  Intel versions < 13.0
  gfortran <= 4.7.2

Reports of working/non-working compilers are appreciated.

Cmake (>=2.8) is used to build the code and examples.  To ensure it uses the
Fortran compiler you intend, set your environment variable FC to the path to
the compiler.  Use the ENABLE_EXAMPLES:BOOL=ON option to cmake to build the
example program (default is OFF).

To link you need version 2.0 of the yajl library.  Source for the library is
hosted at http://lloyd.gitbug.io/yajl.  It is also available as a standard
system package in many Linux distributions; the "yajl" package in Fedora, for
example.
